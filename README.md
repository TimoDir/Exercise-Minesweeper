# Internship task B: Minesweeper

For our new clone of Minesweeper, we will need to generate a board with a certain number of mines randomly placed in it. The board should have a certain number of rows, columns and mines.
For that we use a fonction who wil have as argument:
- A number of rows
- A number of columns
- A number of mines
The output A string grid with a row of cells on each line where "x" marks a cell with a mine and "_" marks an empty cell.
